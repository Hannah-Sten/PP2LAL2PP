# PP2LAL2PP

The **P**racticum **P**rocessor **2** **L**earn **A**ssembly **L**anguage **2** **P**reserve **P**rosperity language is an awesome, but extremely basic little language for a horrible processor. The goal for this language and supplied (in development) compiler is to minimise the work needed to build and debug applications for the PP2-processor used solely in TU/e projects.
The compiler will be able (in the future) to generate nice `.asm`-files all complete with comments to make it understandable even in assembly-form.
Not really that much thought went into it; it is mostly a funny side project.

All hail the perfectly annoying palindrome :)
