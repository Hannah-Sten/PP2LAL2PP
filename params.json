The goal for this language and supplied (in development) compiler is to minimise the work needed to build and debug applications for the PP2-processor used solely in TU/e projects.\r\nThe compiler will be able (in the future) to generate nice `.asm`-files all complete with comments to make it understandable even in assembly-form.\r\nNot really that much thought went into it; it is mostly a funny side project.\r\n\r\nAll hail the perfectly annoying palindrome :)\r\n\r\n## Installation and setup\r\nNot possible (yet).\r\n\r\n## How to compile\r\nNot possible (yet).\r\n\r\n## How to refactor\r\nNot possible (yet).\r\n\r\n## Syntax and language features\r\nSee [Language Specification.md](docs/Language Specification.md).\r\n\r\n## Base API\r\nSee [Base API.md](docs/Base API.md).\r\n",
